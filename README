This is the newest version of the open-source Content Management System Tcms,
using the PHP utility framework pQuery.

The main goal of this project is to test if the minimalistic programming style
of pQuery is suitable for web programming, and could be preferred over the
regular MVC frameworks (especially for small, customized websites).
